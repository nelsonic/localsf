LocalSF
=======

Need to run Queries on your Salesforce Data without being *limited* by Force.com SOQL?
**Done.**

If you're *sick* of not being able to do **Nested Semi-Joins** in your SOQL Queries 
or getting *Time-outs* when querying **"large" datasets**, let me *soothe your pain*.

### Pre-Requisites

The only **pre-requisites** for using this project are:

- ( **Basic** ) Knowledge of **Salesforce.com Admin** (enough to set up **Remote Access** on your Org)
- ( **Basic** ) Google Drive/Docs **Spreadsheet** Skills (To specify which SF Objects you want to *"localise"*)
- ( **Basic** ) **MySQL** Database Setup and Query Skills (create your database and run any queries you want!)
- ( **Basic** ) **Command Line** skills (Terminal) - if you don't have experience, don't worry, you can/will learn!
- ( **Basic** ) **Ruby** (not rails) Knowledge to edit a configuration file and run a script.

**Why Ruby?** ... Its simple for *beginners* to understand and works well for large(ish) data sets.

**Why MySQL?** ... Its *FREE*, Relational fits the Salesforce Tabular Data Model quite well, 
and its easy for beginners to get started and find example queries online. 

**Why Google Docs/Drive?** ... Again *FREE* and provides a familiar/friendly UI to non-technical users.

*Enough Questions! Lets Get Started!* ;-)
